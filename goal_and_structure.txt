Goal of this project is to learn the basics about machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and related stuff.

In a first instance I try to write a simple iteration of the game "flappy bird". First with a hard defined world and later with a randomly generated one.
The next step is to create an interface between the player and the later auto-pilot software which tries to win the game.
In a further step I want to try to create a neural network to find the correlation between what the "bird's" perspective and the ideal user input would be to win the game indefinitely.

If you are experienced in this field, you might have already found out that I am not at this point. Any constructive input is gladly welcome!
